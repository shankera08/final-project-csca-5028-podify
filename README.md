The product that I am developing is called “Podify”, a podcast app. Podify will be a web application which will allow users to stream and listen to podcasts. Podify will cover a wide range of podcasts on topics of interest for the target audience. Users will have access to podcasts that are categorized by specific genres, like arts, business, comedy, education and fiction.
